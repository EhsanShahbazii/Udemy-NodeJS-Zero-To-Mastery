1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:09,690
The next category are runtime errors and a great example for this can be shown with the res write method

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,630
here.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:19,600
Now as I mentioned, you have to return here to prevent the execution of the code after this statement

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,510
otherwise and this is something node specific of course, you would

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,400
end a request here but the code execution would continue

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,570
and eventually we would reach this line and this is no syntax error,

7
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,390
this is correct but if we run our code here, seems to work right,

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,710
there is no syntax error after all.

9
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:44,480
But if we now visit our page, eventually it breaks here and this is the point where it should go back

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,080
to your code and should find an error message there too. And this error message is something you

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,740
shouldn't just take and paste into the Q & A section but actually read it.

12
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,800
A lot of the error messages are indeed helpful,

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,100
you just need to know how to read them, at the bottom

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,310
you always find uninteresting stuff I'd say but you have to scroll to the top of the error message and

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,130
all of a sudden, it should get more meaningful.

16
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,910
For example here, you see the error code which already indicates that it's something with headers being

17
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:27,250
sent and then here, you actually find a detailed error message, cannot set headers after they are set

18
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,100
to the client and then you see that it was caused by a call to set header and unfortunately, the line

19
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,500
numbers don't help you, here at least

20
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,310
but then it does help you here,

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,080
you see it's in the request handler and there it points at the routes.js file line 32. And now this is the

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,630
point where you can dive in and see,

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,640
ok I'm calling set header here,

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:54,100
now since it's complaining that I can't set them after they are sent to the client,

25
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,230
I should look well in the code before this statement because it looks like I'm finishing my response

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:08,810
there for this example. And indeed at some point you should find this statement and see I do actually

27
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,110
not finish my code execution after this statement which is not per se a problem but it becomes a problem

28
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,870
if in the following code, I then work on my response again as I'm doing it here.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:28,130
So now this is the point where we can fix this by stopping the code execution or by wrapping this in an

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,520
extra if statement which is guaranteed to not run

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,690
if we make it into this statement. And now with that, we can of course restart our server

32
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,310
or actually we don't need to,

33
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,060
we got nodemon now so you don't need to do that

34
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,860
and now if you reload your page, it will work again.
