1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,610
Now the third kind of error I want to discuss is the logical error and that is often the most difficult

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,740
one to fix because it will not cause an error message,

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,720
your app will just not behave the way you expect it to.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,140
Let's see here in the routes.js file where we parse our body, we're retrieving the message here and

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:29,960
that is of course nice but let's say I actually do have the first element being stored in message here

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,820
and keep in mind the second element which we previously had is the actual message the user entered because

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,760
we're splitting that key value pair we're getting automatically and now we're actually storing the wrong

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,960
element.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,230
So now if I save this and my server restarts due to nodemon, I can enter some test here

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,620
and if I do this and I open my message text file, I actually see message there.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,910
Now this is a logical error because we got no error message

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,910
but the app is not behaving the way we want it to.

13
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,550
Now of course we know that we used the wrong index here because I just changed that

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,770
but let's say you worked on that code for the first time and you just use zero here because you forgot

15
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,200
that this should be one,

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,290
so you didn't change that back on purpose but you really made this mistake.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,190
Now it's not super obvious to see

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,000
and how can you now work on such errors?

19
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,560
Well with the help of the nodejs

20
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,600
debugger which actually has a great integration into visual studio code which I strongly recommend

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,330
using.

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,740
Let me show you how that debugger works then.

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,450
For this, let's quit that process and let's select the app.js file now, that's important

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:50,090
and now go to debug here in visual studio code in the menu and choose start debugging or use the keyboard

25
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,040
shortcut you see there.

26
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,740
Now with that, you have to choose an environment and there you should use nodejs and you will now see

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,620
that extra bar here at the top which allows you to control the debugger, you see the red bar at the bottom

28
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,080
that indicates that you're in debugging mode and you actually also have a debug console here where you

29
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,960
now see that the debugger is attached and listening.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,940
Now what does this mean?

31
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,570
This means that now you actually can look into your code as it's running

32
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,740
but to really do that, you need to set so-called breakpoints.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,750
So let's go to the route.js file

34
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,040
and let's say we assume it has something to do our error here with the wrong text being stored with

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,290
this code snippet because ultimately, that is where we write it to the file.

36
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,270
So what you can do is you can set a breakpoint in visual studio code by going to the left of the line

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,240
numbers until you see that red dot and clicking there.

38
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,620
Now we got a breakpoint there and what will now happen is that with that debugging process running, don't

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,650
quit this, you can quit it by clicking the red square but let's leave it running,

40
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:03,140
if you now submit some text here, it should automatically jump back and mark this line like this, highlighted

41
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,810
yellow and kind of put this yellow arrow around our breakpoint.

42
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,820
This means that the code execution now stopped here,

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,340
it did not continue,

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,710
it stopped and it stopped

45
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:22,020
so that you can look inside of it and actually you can now analyze your code in the moment it's running.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,690
For example you can hover over your variables to see what's stored inside of them,

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,310
so for example you see that the parsed body is this string which we're splitting in the yellow highlighted line.

48
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,380
You see what's inside of the body you passed to concat, that it's an array with a buffer of length 12

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,470
for example.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,540
You can even expand this to look into it a bit more and find more details about the buffer, in case you're

51
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,080
interested here.

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,700
You also can go to view and then debug here,

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,380
this gives you a special debug mode where you see the key variables you have available in your code

54
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,240
right now,

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,070
message is undefined because we stopped in that line where we would set it

56
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,770
but it stops before it executes the line,

57
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,600
so therefore message is still undefined at this point

58
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,820
but parsed body for example does hold the value, well it has which you can also see if you hover over

59
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,480
it.

60
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,990
You don't just see local variables which are available in this function but block variables too, this is

61
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,320
the variable which is always available outside of this function,

62
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,450
it's this variable

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,690
and you can also look into that therefore and you can generally click around to see some global values

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,270
and the values they currently have stored

65
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,540
and a couple of these things. You also can define watchers here,

66
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,210
for example you can click a plus here and then watch message and hit enter

67
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,150
and now you will always see that here, you also see it up here

68
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,120
but if you ever close that, you can define some variables you're particularly interested in and watch them

69
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,380
whilst you go through your code. And you also see your breakpoints down there,

70
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,000
you see all the breakpoints you set,

71
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,340
you can uncheck them here to not stop execution the next time they are reached and so on.

72
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,310
You also see the call stack which looks very cryptic but what in the end just shows how the process went

73
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,590
through your code and you can click on these different parts to see where actually this code which belongs

74
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,250
to the code that was executed can be found and not all of that is code you wrote, a lot of that is core

75
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,830
nodejs code.

76
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,200
Ok

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,870
so that's the debugger in a nutshell.

78
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,330
Now to work it and to continue with your code execution,

79
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,860
you can use that panel here at the top.

80
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,460
You can resume code execution with the play button but we don't want to do that

81
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,340
instead we want to step through our code step by step so that we can see when it fails or where it goes

82
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,540
wrong.

83
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:56,220
And you can do that with this button which steps to the next line basically or with this button here

84
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,690
which doesn't just step into the next line

85
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,960
but actually even goes into functions like this one.

86
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:09,190
So if you click here and again, now all of a sudden you're in the write file function defined by nodejs

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,650
and you can step out of there with this key. Now you see if you continue here that this wasn't too helpful

88
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,890
but that we can now navigate like this in our code.

89
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,930
So now let's make this more helpful

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,540
and for that, let's try this again and use that debugger properly now.

91
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,210
We'll do this in the next lecture.
