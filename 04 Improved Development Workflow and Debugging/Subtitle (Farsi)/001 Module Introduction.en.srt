00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,360
Now that we already had a pretty close look at nodejs and worked a lot with it,

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,120
let's take one step back and let's see how we can both make development a bit easier, how

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,960
we can speed that up a little bit and most importantly, how we can actually debug our nodejs apps

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,530
or how we can use various tools to understand better what's going on in our nodejs applications.

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,290
Because in this module, you will learn some tips and tricks which will hopefully help you write

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,130
nodejs applications in a very efficient manner.
