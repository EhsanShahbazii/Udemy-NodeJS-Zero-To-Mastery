1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,810
For this module I'm back in the application or the project we worked on in the last core section and you

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:15,190
can find my state attached to this video so that you can start right at the same point as I do.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,900
So it is just the code we wrote over the last lectures

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:25,280
and one thing we constantly had to do in the last section or throughout this course was that we always

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:33,890
had to run node app.js to start our well app or our node application with that file.

6
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:41,240
Now this is certainly ok and not too much work but it actually is possible to define some scripts in

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,190
a nodejs project that can help us with tasks like this,

8
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,620
we can also use them for other tasks but especially for this, they can be useful right now

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,120
and for that we have to use a feature we didn't use thus far.

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:04,490
We have to use npm, npm stands for node package manager and it is installed together with nodejs, so

11
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,960
you don't need to do anything,

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,000
you got this installed already.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,890
Now we will also use npm to install some additional third party packages to our project soon, so packages

14
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,930
that are not included in nodes core,

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:29,240
so not part of nodes core modules but we can also use npm to initialize a so-called node project or

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,870
to add some extra features to it

17
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:39,050
to be precise because we obviously already got a node project here but now in this project, in a terminal

18
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,400
navigated into this project, you can run npm init.

19
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,090
Now this will not delete your code or anything like that,

20
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,080
no worries,

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,840
simply hit enter and you'll be prompted with a couple of questions here.

22
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,330
It'll ask you first of all for a name of your package

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,670
and for now you can simply translate this with project name.

24
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,990
Now you can pick any name you want, the part in the parentheses here

25
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,930
always is the suggestion, the default

26
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,730
it will pick if you don't choose your own name,

27
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,270
so if I just hit enter here, it will take that default.

28
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,420
So you can basically do that for all these questions,

29
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,260
for the description, you can leave that empty

30
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,550
then it will have no default text either but you can also enter some text like complete nodejs

31
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:32,970
guide, this is what this course is and then define an entry point with fs for example. You can leave

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,750
the task command empty, leave that empty, keywords you can choose some if you want,

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,900
you can put your name into the offer field though this is also not required and you can always choose

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,470
a license

35
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,030
but if you don't plan on sharing this project publicly,

36
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,600
this also doesn't really matter.

37
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:54,210
So with this what you get is this package.json file and there you also see all these settings

38
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,270
or configurations you just set up and you can of course edit them there too,

39
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,160
so if you had a typo in your description, you can just edit it here.

40
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,880
Now this is using the json format which is a special kind of data format which basically looks a

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,750
lot like javascript objects and it pretty much is based on that,

42
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,200
there is one important thing to understand though,

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:24,330
the keys are always put between double quotation marks and so are the values, except for numbers or arrays

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,190
or true or false which are not put between these

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,100
but that's too much

46
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,780
for now, we can ignore that for now just so that you understand what you got there,

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,250
it's basically a configuration file for your project.

48
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,070
Now what does this configuration file give you?

49
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,600
Well let's clear the console here,

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,450
with this configuration file, you'll see that we got a scripts section there which has one default script

51
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,340
that won't do anything for now,

52
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,190
you can add your own scripts here and I will tell you how to execute them too of course.

53
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,040
For that, let's add a comma after this test script and add a new script name which has to be put between

54
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,220
double quotation marks and there, let's name it start. Now

55
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,430
start is actually a special script name as you will see in a second,

56
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,950
so make sure to type this correctly and then between the quotation marks,

57
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,880
you type a command that should be executed.

58
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,830
So this is a command which you could also type down there

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,490
and there we always have to type

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,970
node app.js,

61
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,230
so let's now put that between these double quotation marks here

62
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,890
node app.js,

63
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,740
like this.

64
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,870
With that save that file

65
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:42,930
and then you can run npm start. Start is a reserved name and this will always look for such a start

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,850
script here.

67
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,610
And if you do that, it will as you can see here just execute node app.js.

68
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,620
So it does the same you had before but now you can always just well run this command instead of running

69
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:55,890
node

70
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,870
app.js. Not that much of a saved characters but a few at least

71
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,590
and it's also a good practice because if you ever share this project,

72
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,350
it's pretty common that people just have to run npm start and that they don't have to guess which of your

73
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,180
javascript files is the entry file.

74
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,200
So you can quit this with control c of course as always and I mentioned that this would be a special

75
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,340
script name.

76
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,780
You can add more scripts, also without using a special name,

77
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
you can indeed choose any name you want,

78
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,710
just make sure to always wrap the name in double quotation marks and that it does not contain any blanks

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,490
or whitespaces.

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,610
So for example we could have start-server.

81
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,930
Now this can also run node app.js,

82
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,350
so it will do the exact same as this script and therefore it's of course redundant

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,940
but I want to show you something

84
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,730
and now if you try running npm start-server, you'll get an error.

85
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,930
You basically get an error that is not a known command and indeed it isn't because just typing

86
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,030
the script name here will not work,

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,630
start

88
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,210
just was the special case as I mentioned.

89
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,890
Indeed for normal scripts with their own custom names, you have to run npm run and then your script name,

90
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,960
so npm run start-server will now also start the server.

91
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,770
Now as I mentioned, this is of course redundant, npm start is way shorter but I want you to understand

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,880
how you can add your own scripts.

93
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,800
Now if you worked with something like angular or react or vue or any modern frontend development workflow,

94
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,620
you will have seen that you use such scripts a lot to trigger build workflows for your projects for

95
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,620
example and indeed you can use that for all kinds of tasks to want to execute

96
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,550
but for now we'll not dive deeper into that and if you haven't worked with angular or react, it's

97
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,810
also

98
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,780
no problem,

99
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,340
you will see what I mean

100
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,900
later in this course when I explore node's functionality as a build tool a bit more.

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,420
For now let's just use that npm start script to start our application conveniently.
