00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,930
Syntax errors can be very annoying

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,190
but most of the time, they're not that hard to fix.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:13,330
Let's add a simple syntax error, here in app.js let's simply remove the t in const,

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,990
now all of a sudden, this is an invalid keyword,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,050
it doesn't exist, it's not a keyword

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,270
and we already get some help in the IDE which is showing us something is wrong here.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,010
Now if we hover over this, we see that a semi-colon is expected

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,450
and actually this is not that helpful

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,020
and this is simply because visual studio code thinks so that this is a variable

10
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,470
and since we have a variable in the same line, we should close this with a semi-colon

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,550
and now it actually doesn't show an error. But let's save this and let's try running our app with npm

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,160
start without that semi-colon we added. And you will see, it right away

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,110
crashes and in there we see unexpected identifier const server.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,040
So in the end, whilst it doesn't clearly tell us that we forgot the t here because it's not smart enough

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,120
to understand that this is the error here,

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,930
we still see that the error seems to be stemming from this line

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,890
and in such cases, as dumb as it sounds, you should simply take a closer look at this line and see what

18
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,980
could be wrong there

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,270
and you should quickly be able to see

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,780
I forgot a t here.

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,730
So these are syntax errors,

22
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:29,400
other errors would be that you maybe go to the routes.js file and let's say you forget a closing curly

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,390
brace here.

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,680
Now again visual studio code does complain and does show an error over there,

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,590
if we jump there we see at the end that the closing curly brace is expected.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,130
Now it's not expected at this point where it's showing this message but it's expected somewhere in the

27
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,670
file and whilst it can be cumbersome,

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,170
you should then check your block statements like this if statement and see if there are all closed correctly.

29
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,870
In visual studio code, you also get some help because if you click next to such a curly brace, you'll see

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,860
that this line gets highlighted and it actually shows you where it thinks that this is getting closed

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,570
and this is far too much at the bottom here

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:14,610
for example. Again if you run this, you will see that it crashes and there, you also see unexpected token

33
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,750
and it points us at routes.js

34
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,170
.

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,650
and then you see the line number too.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,370
So here it points us at line 52 and it basically shows us the same place as visual studio code which

37
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,600
is the wrong place

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,870
but in such a case here, you should really take the IDE help, see that error message and then go through

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,430
your file and see

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,850
hmm where could I be missing a character or where do I have an extra closing curly brace or something

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,540
like that

42
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,090
and eventually you should be able to find this error and therefore of course fix it.

43
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,820
So syntax errors should always result in an error message and then that can sometimes be hard to find

44
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,490
them,

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,880
often it's like a typo, a mistyped variable name of a variable that therefore doesn't exist or missing

46
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,190
or extra characters but you can find them and it just takes some time to go through your file.
